			<h2>Some Definations</h2>

				<li>
					<p>
						<h3>Node Defination</h3>
						A node is a point of intersection/connection within a network. In an environment where all devices are accessible through the network, these devices are all considered nodes. The concept of nodes works on several levels, but the big-picture view defines nodes as the major centers through which Internet traffic is typically routed. This usage is somewhat confusing, as these same Internet nodes are also referred to as Internet hubs.

					<h3>Cluster Orchestration</h3>
					<p>
						Clusters are a group of servers, managing and scheduling of clusters is Cluster Orchestration.

		 	<h2>Use of <a href="Kubernetes.html">Kubernetes</a></h2>
		 	<p>
		 		With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to be released and updated in an easy and fast way without downtime. Kubernetes helps you make sure those containerized applications run where and when you want, and helps them find the resources and tools they need to work. Kubernetes is a production-ready, open source platform designed with Google's accumulated experience in container orchestration, combined with best-of-breed ideas from the community.
